# Doggo Loggo

A full-stack web application that lets dog-owners track/share their dog's daily activities!

I wanted to build this project because I am a dog-owner myself, and wanted a convenient application to track my dog's daily activities, and be able to share them with my family-members/friends. Having a cute dog played a huge role in keeping me motivated to build the application.
